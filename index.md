# Welcome to my webpage!

My name is Samvathna Em. I'm currently studying _Computer Science_ at UCSD. <br>
This is a field I am very passionate about, and I am eager to learn, challenge, and grow in it.<br>

Greetings from my corner of the internet! Since Java is my most programming language, I'd like to greet you in the way I am most comfortable - with code. Here's a simple Hello program that captures my excitement:

```java
public class Hello{

    public static void main(String[] args)
    {
        System.out.println("Welcome to my webpage!");
    }
}
```
